# The-Flood-Game---C-to-MIPS-Translation
Translated a complete C implementation of the Flood puzzle game into MIPS assembly. Rewrote all game logic at the assembly level while preserving identical behaviour, controls, and output. Worked under strict constraints with no data-section changes, demonstrating low-level control flow, memory management, and calling-convention mastery.
